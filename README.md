let input = prompt("what would you like to do?");: This line prompts the user to enter their desired action for the to-do list, such as adding, deleting, or listing tasks.

const todos = ["Collect Chicken Eggs", "Clean Litter Box"];: This initializes an array called todos which stores the list of to-do items. Initially, it contains two sample tasks.

while (input !== "quit" && input !== "q") { ... }: This while loop continues as long as the user does not input "quit" or "q", indicating they want to exit the application. Inside the loop, different actions are performed based on the user input.

Inside the loop:

If the user input is "list", the code iterates through the todos array and prints each item along with its index.
If the input is "new", the code prompts the user to enter a new to-do item, which is then added to the todos array.
If the input is "delete", the code prompts the user to enter the index of the item they want to delete. It then removes that item from the todos array using the splice method.
input = prompt("what would you like to do?");: This line prompts the user again to enter their desired action, keeping the loop running until they choose to quit.

Once the loop exits (when the user inputs "quit" or "q"), the code prints "OK QUIT THE APP!" indicating that the user has chosen to quit the application.
